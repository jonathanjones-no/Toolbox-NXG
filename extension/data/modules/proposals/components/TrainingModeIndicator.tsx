/**
 * Modbar indicator for the current user's training status on the subreddit they're

 * proposals for another moderator to review rather than taking effect immediately - the
 * counterpart to the per-thing capture the gateway performs. For a moderator without wiki
 * permission it instead explains why the wiki-backed toolbox features are unavailable
 * (their actions are live). Renders nothing otherwise.
 *
 * Rendered as a glyph in the modbar's right-hand counter group (just left of the
 * proposals icon) so it reads as a sibling of the modmail/modqueue/proposals counters;
 * the explanation lives in its tooltip.
